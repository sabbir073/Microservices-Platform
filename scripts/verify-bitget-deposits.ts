/**
 * Bitget, and the crypto fields the deposit rail needed to carry it.
 *
 * The platform already had the right shape for this — admin-configured manual
 * deposit methods with an account, a QR, instructions and a percentage fee —
 * so Bitget is a method on that rail rather than a second payment system. What
 * it did NOT have is everything crypto-specific:
 *
 *   network    the chain to send on. The single most expensive field on the
 *              page: USDT sent on BEP20 to a TRC20 address is unrecoverable.
 *   memo       required by some exchanges to attribute the transfer at all.
 *   feeFlatUsd a network fee costs the same on $5 as on $5,000, so a
 *              percentage either overstates or hides it.
 *   autoQr     draw the QR from the account, so it cannot keep pointing at a
 *              wallet the admin has since changed.
 *
 * The money assertions are the point of this file. `charge` is what the user
 * pays ON TOP of the amount credited to their wallet, and a flat fee that
 * quietly became a percentage — or a percentage that started applying to
 * methods with none — is a silent overcharge on every deposit.

/**
 * Rich task instructions.
 *
 * The field was a row of plain <input> steps: no bold, no colour, no image, no
 * link, no alignment, and a paste from ChatGPT arrived as literal `##` and `**`
 * with every heading flattened. It is a Tiptap editor now.
 *
 * The load-bearing risk is not the editor — it is that `Task.instructions` is
 * full of the OLD plain-text format and nothing migrates it. Both shapes have
 * to render, forever, everywhere. Most of this file is about that.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-rich-instructions.ts

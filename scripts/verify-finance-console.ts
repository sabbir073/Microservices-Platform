 * Finance console verification.

 * Almost all of this is about **truthfulness**, because a finance report that
 * is merely wrong is worse than one that is missing — the owner acts on it.
 *
 * The signing rules matter most. `Transaction` is a per-user wallet ledger whose
 * conventions drifted across ~48 write sites: `PURCHASE` is positive for
 * subscriptions and negative everywhere else, `ADMIN_FEE` is stored negative
 * while being income, `POINTS_CONVERSION` carries opposite meanings in its two
 * columns, and `EARNING` covers both platform cost and user-to-user proceeds.
 * Every one of the 18 types is asserted here, so a type added later with no rule
 * fails loudly rather than defaulting to zero.

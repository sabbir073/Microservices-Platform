 * Everything here is a number the owner makes decisions on, so the checks are

 * wrong is worse than one that is missing: he acts on it.
 *
 * Four of these guard bugs that were actually live:
 *   - /admin/finance showed remaining budget under the title "Ad Spend"
 *   - eCPM divided by impressions that structurally cannot earn (network)
 *   - impressions were counted for network ads that were never rendered
 *   - "ad credit purchased" reported the bonus as if it were cash
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-ads-reporting.ts

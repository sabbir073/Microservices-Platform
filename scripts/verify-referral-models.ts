 * The five referral models, and what each of them actually pays.
 *
 * Audited against the owner's list. Three existed, two did not:
 *
 *   1. Two-way (both sides paid)  — MISSING: only the referrer was ever paid,
 *      so the person actually signing up had no reason to use a link.
 *   2. Sign-up                    — existed.
 *   3. Milestone                  — MISSING entirely.
 *   4. Purchase-based             — existed for packages only.
 *   5. Multi-tier                 — existed (ReferralLevel), untouched by
 *      request: "ager tier jeivabe banay silam oita oi vabei thakbe".
 *
 * The properties worth guarding are the ones that cost money when wrong:
 * every award is idempotent on its own reference, milestones cannot be farmed
 * with accounts that never verify, and the invitee's half is not silently
 * withheld for something the referrer did.

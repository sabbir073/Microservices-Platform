/**
 * Two pots that must never become one.
 *
 * `pointsBalance` is what a worker EARNS: it mirrors into `totalEarnings`, it
 * converts to cash, and cash can be withdrawn. `taskCreditPoints` is what a
 * buyer BUYS to fund tasks.
 *
 * If the two ever met, buying points would be buying withdrawable balance —
 * money in, money straight back out, with a "completed task" as the paperwork.
 * That is a laundering path and a chargeback one at once, and it would not look
 * like a bug from the inside: every individual write would be correct.
 *
 * So this asserts the separation from BOTH directions, by reading the source of
 * every path that touches either balance:
 *   - nothing that credits earnings may write task credit
 *   - task credit may never be converted to cash or withdrawn
 *   - task budgets may never be funded from earned points or cash
 *   - a refund goes back as CREDIT, not as money
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-task-credit.ts

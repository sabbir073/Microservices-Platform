/**
 * Staff must not appear on any public ranking.
 *
 * The owner's rule: nobody who works on the platform shows up in Top Earners or
 * on `/leaderboard`. Measured before the fix (`report-staff-in-leaderboard.ts`),
 * 4 of the top 5 earners and 5 of the top 5 on XP were staff accounts.
 *
 * These checks are structural rather than behavioural because the failure mode
 * is not "the filter breaks" — it is "someone adds a fifth board, or a second
 * Top Earners widget, and forgets the filter". So every ranking query in the
 * public paths is enumerated here by hand: adding one without a `where` makes
 * this suite fail, which is the whole point.

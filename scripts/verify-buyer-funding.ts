/**
 * Buyers funding tasks — the rules an admin can set, and the money.
 *
 * `POST /api/tasks/create` already debited a buyer's wallet and held the reward
 * pool against the task, but every rule around it was a literal in that file:
 * hardcoded task types, Zod ceilings, no floor, no KYC gate, and **no platform
 * fee at all** — a buyer paid exactly the point value of the rewards and the
 * platform earned nothing on the transaction it exists to intermediate.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than the rest and are asserted directly, because
 * they are the ones a later edit would quietly drop:
 *
 *  1. **One quote.** The invoice the buyer reads and the amount the server
 *     debits come from the same `quoteTask`. Two implementations drift by a
 *     rounding step and the buyer reads that as being overcharged.
 *  2. **A rejected task refunds the fee.** Keeping a commission on a task you
 *     refused is the fastest way to lose the buyer, and it is a default, not an
 *     accident — `buyer.refund_fee_on_reject` can turn it off deliberately.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-buyer-funding.ts

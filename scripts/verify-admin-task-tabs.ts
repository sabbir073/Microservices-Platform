/**
 * Admin task list — one tab per status the admin actually has to work through.
 *
 * Every task was listed together, and the only way to narrow it was four stat
 * cards that happened to be links. Two problems in one control: they read as a
 * dashboard rather than as a filter, and each one was a bare
 * `/admin/tasks?status=X`, so switching status threw away whatever type, board
 * or search was already applied.
 *
 * The gap that mattered most was what the cards did NOT offer. Archived tasks
 * had no entry point at all — and archiving is what happens instead of
 * deleting, because a task's submissions are the record of work users were
 * paid for. Expired had none either, and this database holds 13 of them.
 *
 * The check worth keeping is the last one: every status with real rows in it
 * has a way to be seen. A status added later, with tasks quietly accumulating
 * in it and no tab, is exactly the state this page was already in.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-admin-task-tabs.ts

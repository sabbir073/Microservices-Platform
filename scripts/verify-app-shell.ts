 * App shell: the rail scrolls, and there is one definition of "home".
 *
 * Two failures this pins down, both of which look fine in code review:
 *
 *  - A `sticky` column with no `max-height` and no `overflow` has no scrollbar
 *    of its own, so anything past the fold is simply unreachable. Either half of
 *    the fix alone leaves it broken, which is why both are asserted.
 *  - `/social` and `/dashboard` were both used as "the user's home page" in
 *    different files. The middleware sent a non-admin hitting /admin to
 *    `/social` while the admin page's own guard sent the same person to
 *    `/dashboard` — two answers in one request path.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.script.json scripts/verify-app-shell.ts

          from a parent selector that does not reach the child;
       d) the failure mode of the LAST pass: tokens defined, components left
          on the classes they already had, and the whole thing reported as a
          redesign while looking identical.

     (d) is why the checks below name specific strings that were REMOVED.

/**
 * Look at a submission again, a little later.
 *
 * A social page is often not ready at the instant it is published — the pin,
 * post or tweet exists, but the server-rendered copy the fetcher sees has not
 * caught up, so the first check says "couldn't read this" and the submission
 * waits for a human. Nothing is wrong with the work; we simply asked too early.
 *
 * So anything that came out `unverifiable` gets asked again a minute or two on.
 * If the page now says what the admin required, the submission is approved and
 * paid exactly as if it had verified the first time.
 *
 * ── Two rules this must never break ──
 *
 * 1. **It only ever APPROVES.** A background job that rejects people is a very
 *    different thing from one that pays them: nobody is present to see it
 *    happen, so a false negative would land as an unexplained rejection. A
 *    submission that now genuinely fails its criteria is left PENDING for a
 *    human, whatever `onMismatch` says.
 *
 * 2. **It cannot pay twice.** It claims the row with the same CAS the admin
 *    review uses (`updateMany` while still PENDING), and writes the ledger under
 *    the same `task_<taskId>_<submissionId>` reference as both existing paths,
 *    so `Transaction @@unique([userId, reference])` is a second line of defence
 *    against this and the other two writers racing.

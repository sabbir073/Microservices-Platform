  // ── Counting: the same basis as the other 24 spaces ──────────────────────
  //
  // IN_FEED used to count NOTHING here. Its entire impression figure came from
  // the client `kind:"view"` beacon, which is deduped per (ad, viewer, minute),
  // while every other space counts server-side at delivery with no dedup at all
  // — a banner on a 12-second rotation books five impressions a minute for one
  // viewer sitting still. Put side by side in the same report table, IN_FEED
  // therefore looked roughly an order of magnitude weaker than spaces it may
  // well outperform, for a reason that has nothing to do with performance. A
  // report that ranks the owner's inventory has to rank it on one ruler.
  //
  // The ruler chosen is DELIVERY, server-side, no dedup: it is what 24 of the 25
  // spaces already record (so the existing history stays comparable), it costs
  // no extra write on the hot path, and it does not depend on a client beacon
  // that an ad blocker can strip — which matters on an ad stack built
  // specifically to survive blockers.
  //
  // Stated plainly, because it is the cost of that choice: the feed client
  // prefetches a POOL and spaces it through the scroll, so a session abandoned
  // early leaves some delivered creatives unseen and counted. The banner path
  // has the mirror-image flaw (a rotation counts whether or not the viewer
  // looked). Neither is a viewability metric and neither is sold as one.
  //
  // The `kind:"view"` beacon no longer increments any counter (see
  // `recordImpression` in ad-events.ts), so this does not double-count.
  // Same bot rule as the single-ad path above — one test, both rulers, or the
  // feed and every other space would be measuring different audiences again.
  // Since 2026-10-06 nothing is counted as an impression here: each card is
  // stamped as SERVED below, and counted as an impression only when the
  // card's viewability beacon comes back (src/lib/ad-measure.ts).
  // Fill data, like every other placement. Without it a feed with no eligible
  // demand and a feed nobody opened were indistinguishable in the fill report —
  // IN_FEED was the one space in the list with no denominator at all.

 * pool reads. The client now coalesces them (ad-batch-client.ts) and this

 *

 * chosen added to the exclusion list, so the same creative is not shown twice
 * on one screen while the pool has an alternative. Different spaces hold

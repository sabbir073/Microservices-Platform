/**
 * The scheduler's lock.
 *
 * One row per (job, due window). Claiming a window is a `create` against
 * `@@unique([job, windowKey])` — the database decides the winner, there is no
 * read-then-write, and a loser's `create` costs one failed insert.
 *
 * A tick can die at any point (serverless kills work started after the
 * response), so a claim carries a LEASE. While the lease holds, nobody else may
 * touch the window. Once it expires, a later tick may take the window over with
 * a conditional update whose `where` names the expected state — an expired
 * lease and a state that is not `completed`. `count === 1` is the proof that
 * this tick, and only this tick, won it.
 *
 * Taking a window over re-runs the job. That is safe, and deliberately so:
 * every job in the registry is independently idempotent, so a resumed run
 * finishes what the dead one started instead of doing it twice.
 *
 * This file is deliberately dependency-free — no Prisma, no Next — so the
 * concurrency and half-dead-tick behaviour can be exercised directly. The
 * Prisma-backed store lives in `./prisma-store`, and the store is injectable so
 * these rules can be exercised without a database
 * (see `scripts/verify-staff-off-leaderboard`).

 * Everything the platform used to ask a cron to call.

 * window before another tick is allowed to take it over. It does NOT implement
 * anything: every `run` here is a thin call into the same library the manual
 * admin button and the HTTP endpoint call, so there is exactly one copy of each
 * piece of work.
 *
 * The non-negotiable property of anything added to this list: running it twice
 * must be harmless. The scheduler guarantees one winner per window, but a tick
 * that is killed mid-flight WILL be retried once its lease expires.

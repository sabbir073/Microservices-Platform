/**
 * Windowed ad revenue — the one place that answers "how much did ads earn
 * between these two dates".
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every revenue figure on the platform used to read `AdCampaign.spentTotal`,
 * which is a LIFETIME counter with no date on it. So a date filter changed
 * every other number on the page and left ad revenue standing still — a
 * "September" report quoting the all-time total next to twelve windowed ones.
 *
 * `AdDailyStat` has the per-day figures (`@@unique([adId, date])`), so the
 * window is real here. Two things make it not a plain `sum(spendUsd)`:
 *
 *  1. **House ads.** A house campaign bills itself: `ad-events.ts` skips the
 *     charge, but rows written before that skip existed left roughly $1.95 of
 *     self-billing in `AdDailyStat.spendUsd`. It is money the platform "paid"
 *     itself and it is NOT revenue. `scripts/fix-house-campaign-spend.ts`
 *     cleared `AdCampaign.spentTotal` but never touched the daily rows.
 *  2. **Network ads.** ADSENSE and GAM are billed by Google, not by us; their
 *     earnings arrive in a Google report and never pass through this table.
 *     Counting the local spend column for them would invent revenue.
 *
 * That pair — `!campaign.isHouse && type !== "ADSENSE" && type !== "GAM"` — is
 * the exclusion the report and analytics panels already apply, written out by
 * hand in four places. `isNetworkAdType` and `adRevenueWindow` are now the one
 * definition; a fifth copy is how the figures start disagreeing.
 *
 * Historical rates are never re-derived: `spendUsd` is what was actually
 * billed, so a CPC change today does not rewrite last month's revenue.

/**
 * The catalog of every admin setting: its key, its name, and what it does.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * Settings on this platform have failed twice in the same way. First, 44 of
 * 104 controls wrote a `SystemSetting` row that nothing read — Save said
 * "saved" and nothing changed. Second, the withdrawal-fee box wrote
 * `withdrawal_fee_pct` while every payout read `withdrawal_fee_percent`, so
 * users were charged 5% when the owner had set 2.5%. Both failures are the
 * same bug: the label an admin reads and the key the code reads drifted apart
 * because they lived in different places.
 *
 * So they live here, together, in one row per setting. The form renders the
 * label and description FROM this file (`system-settings-form.tsx` passes only
 * `settingKey`), the save routine derives which tab owns a key FROM this file,
 * and the search box indexes this file. A setting cannot be renamed in one
 * place and not the other, because there is only one place.
 *
 * ORDER
 * -----
 * `SETTING_GROUPS` is ordered deliberately, most-reached-for first, and each
 * group carries an explicit `order`. Within a group, array order here is the
 * display order — also deliberate, not "whoever added a control last".
 *
 * STATUS
 * ------
 * `status: "not-active"` marks a control that is saved but not yet honoured by
 * any code path. The UI renders those with a visible badge. The one thing that
 * is never acceptable is a control that looks live and is not.
 *
 * `scripts/verify-settings-truth.ts` enforces all of the above.

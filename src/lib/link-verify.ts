/**
 * Smart Auto Verification — does a submitted proof page actually say what the
 * task asked for?
 *
 * A user finishes a social task and submits the URL of what they published. The
 * server already fetches that page to check the user's personal code
 * (`task-verify-code.ts`). This adds the other half: comparing the page against
 * criteria the admin set — a required link, keywords, hashtags, a username.
 *
 * ── Three verdicts, and the difference between two of them matters most ──
 *
 *   verified         every required criterion was found → safe to auto-approve
 *   criteria_failed  the page was READ, and it genuinely does not match
 *   unverifiable     we could not read the page at all
 *
 * `unverifiable` is not a soft `criteria_failed`. Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn
 * and X serve a login page to any server-side fetch, so "we saw no keyword" is
 * usually a statement about our access, not about the user's work. Only
 * `criteria_failed` may ever auto-reject; `unverifiable` always goes to a human.
 * Getting that backwards would reject honest users for a limitation of ours,
 * which is the worst failure this feature can have.
 *
 * ── Why the text is extracted rather than substring-matched on raw HTML ──
 *
 * `contentHasCode` scans raw HTML, which is fine for an 8-character random code
 * — it cannot plausibly appear by accident. A keyword can: "discount" sits in a
 * nav menu, an analytics script, a cookie banner. So a corpus is built from the
 * parts of the document that represent what was published (OG/Twitter cards,
 * title, visible body) with scripts and styles removed first.
 *
 * Client-safe: no server-only imports, so the admin task builder and the submit
 * route share one definition of what a rule is.

/**
 * Close finished leaderboard cycles and pay the winners.
 *
 * This is the whole of what `lb_auto_reset` turns on. It lives in a library
 * rather than in the route because there are now two ways to reach it — the
 * in-process scheduler that runs off site traffic, and `/api/cron/
 * leaderboard-reset` for anyone who still wants to call an endpoint — and two
 * copies of a payout is exactly how a platform pays twice.
 *
 * ── Timezone: UTC, everywhere ──
 * `cycleKey` buckets on UTC, so a day is 00:00Z–00:00Z, a week is Monday
 * 00:00Z, and a month is the 1st at 00:00Z. That is 06:00 in Asia/Dhaka, which
 * is the honest trade: one fixed instant worldwide beats a local midnight that
 * drifts with DST and could bucket the same window under two different ids —
 * which is how you pay twice.
 *
 * ── Missed windows ──
 * It does not ask "when did I last run". Each call computes the most recently
 * CLOSED window from the calendar (`lastClosedWindowAnchor`) and tries to pay
 * it. So:
 *   - a deploy, an outage, or a platform nobody visited for two days delays the
 *     payout to the next call and never skips it;
 *   - every later call inside the same window is a no-op, because the cycle is
 *     sealed `completed` and short-circuits before any ranking query runs;
 *   - and if it did somehow reach the payout, the ledger's
 *     `@@unique([userId, reference])` would reject the second credit anyway.

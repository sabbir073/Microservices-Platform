/**
 * Task credit — points bought to fund tasks, kept strictly apart from points
 * earned.
 *
 * The separation is the whole point of this module, so it is worth stating why
 * rather than leaving it to be rediscovered:
 *
 * `User.pointsBalance` is what a worker EARNS. It mirrors into `totalEarnings`,
 * it converts to cash (`points-convert.ts`), and cash can be withdrawn. If task
 * budgets came out of that same column, then buying points would be buying
 * withdrawable balance — money in, money straight back out, with a completed
 * "task" as the paperwork. That is a laundering path and a chargeback one at
 * the same time.
 *
 * So `taskCreditPoints` has exactly one way in and one way out:
 *   IN  — `purchaseTaskCredit`, paid for with wallet cash.
 *   OUT — `chargeTaskCompletion`, one approved completion at a time.
 *
 * Credit is charged **as it is used**, not reserved when the task is created.
 * A task advertised to 100 people whose first 10 complete costs the buyer 10
 * rewards; the other 90 never leave their balance. That is the owner's model
 * and it is the better one: reserving up front strands money in tasks that
 * expire half-finished, which then needs a refund path for every way a task
 * can end (expired, paused, archived, closed early) — and the one that gets
 * forgotten silently keeps the buyer's points.
 *
 * Nothing that credits earnings may write it, it is never converted to cash,
 * and it is never withdrawn. `scripts/verify-task-credit.ts` asserts all of
 * that from both directions, because the invariant is only worth as much as
 * what stops the next edit breaking it.

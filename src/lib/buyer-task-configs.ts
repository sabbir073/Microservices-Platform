/**
 * QUIZ, ARTICLE and APPINSTALL, as a buyer posts them.
 *
 * Built to the SURVEY precedent (`survey-buyer.ts`): one zod schema per type,
 * imported by BOTH /api/tasks/create and /api/tasks/mine/[id], plus one builder
 * that turns the parsed body into the exact config column the existing worker
 * runner already reads. No new money path — completions are charged through
 * `chargeTaskCompletion` like every other type.
 *
 * Two copies of a schema is how an edit ends up accepting something a create
 * refuses, which is why there is one of each and it lives here.
 *
 * Each of these three carries a hazard the other buyer types do not. They are
 * named at the schema that answers them, not in a design doc:
 *
 *  QUIZ       — the answer key must never reach the worker's browser.
 *  ARTICLE    — the buyer is paying for words, and words get pasted.
 *  APPINSTALL — the most fraud-prone type on the platform.

/* ────────────────────────────── QUIZ ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * HAZARD: the answer key.
 *
 * This platform has already shipped a quiz that sent `correctAnswer` down with
 * every question, so the key sat in the network tab of anyone who pressed F12.
 * It was fixed in `/api/tasks/quiz` — `toPlayerQuestions()` builds a stripped
 * `{id, question, options}` and grading reads the key from the TASK ROW, never
 * from the request body. Opening QUIZ to buyers must not walk that back.
 *
 * So this module writes into exactly the same column (`Task.questions`) in
 * exactly the same shape a buyer-authored quiz and an admin-authored quiz are
 * indistinguishable to the runner — which is the point. There is no
 * buyer-specific quiz endpoint, no buyer-specific player, and therefore no
 * second place for the key to leak from. A verification check asserts the
 * player payload still has no `correctAnswer` in it.
 *
 * The second, quieter hazard is AI spend: `/api/tasks/quiz` falls back to
 * Gemini generation for a QUIZ task with no usable questions, and persists the
 * result to the task row. A buyer must therefore never be able to create a quiz
 * task with an empty question set — `min(1)` below, enforced server-side on
 * create AND on edit, is what keeps a buyer from commissioning unmetered AI.

 *
 * HAZARD: you are paying for writing, and writing gets pasted.

 *
 *   BUILT   a minimum word count, enforced on submit, refusing short work
 *           outright because the buyer stated the number up front;
 *   BUILT   exact-duplicate detection against the other submissions on THIS
 *           task, after normalising case, spacing and punctuation;
 *   BUILT   near-duplicate detection on the same set (word-trigram containment)
 *           and a self-repetition score that catches one paragraph pasted four
 *           times to hit the count;
 *   BUILT   an originality NOTE on every submission, visible to whoever
 *           reviews it.
 *
 *   NOT     plagiarism detection. Nothing here searches the web, and nothing
 *           here can tell a buyer whether an article was lifted from a blog,
 *           translated, spun, or generated. Do not describe it as if it could.
 *   NOT     cross-task duplicate detection. The comparison set is one task.
 *   NOT     an auto-reject on similarity. Only the word count refuses; a
 *           similarity score is evidence for a human, because two people
 *           writing about the same product will legitimately collide.
 *
 * The implementation is `src/lib/article-originality.ts`; the enforcement is in
 * /api/tasks/[id]/submit. `autoApprove` is forced OFF for a buyer writing task
 * — the whole point is that somebody reads it.

/* ──────────────────────────── APPINSTALL ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * HAZARD: this is the most defrauded type there is. An "install" is a

 *
 * The platform already has the answer: per-task structured proof requirements
 * (`AppInstallConfig.proofItems`), where each item can demand a screenshot
 * and/or a typed value, and kinds like LEVEL / DAYS / PLAYTIME ask for things
 * that take real time in the app rather than one tap. The admin builder has had
 * this since the app-install proof work.
 *
 * The buyer therefore does not get the weak default. `defaultProofItems()` is a
 * single "screenshot of the app open" — fine as a back-compat fallback for old
 * admin rows, useless as a fraud defence — so `proofItems` is REQUIRED here,
 * `min(1)`, and the form makes the buyer pick. A buyer who wants only an
 * install screenshot can still choose exactly that, but they will have chosen
 * it.
 *
 * `autoApprove` is not in the schema at all. A buyer cannot auto-approve their
 * own app-install task, because auto-approving the most fraud-prone type is the

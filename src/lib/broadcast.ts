/**
 * Admin broadcasts — one notification or email, delivered to an audience of any
 * size without a request having to stay alive for it.
 *
 * What this replaces: the send endpoint used to load every recipient id into
 * memory, write them all in one `createMany`, and then send emails forty at a
 * time inside the same HTTP request. Past a few thousand users that request
 * cannot finish inside a function's time limit, and when it died there was no
 * record of who had already been written to — so a retry either double-notified
 * everyone or the admin simply stopped pressing the button. Scheduling was
 * worse than incomplete: it wrote an audit row saying "scheduled" and nothing,
 * anywhere, ever sent it.
 *
 * The shape now:
 *
 *   1. `createBroadcast` writes ONE row and returns. Nothing is delivered yet.
 *   2. `deliverBroadcast` moves it forward by a bounded amount of work — some
 *      recipients enumerated, some notifications written, some emails sent —
 *      and returns. It is safe to call from anywhere, at any time, twice at
 *      once.
 *   3. The scheduler calls it every minute until the broadcast is finished; the
 *      send endpoint also calls it once inline, so a message to five people is
 *      already delivered by the time the admin's screen refreshes.
 *
 * Every "have I done this yet?" lives in `BroadcastRecipient`, not in a running
 * function, which is what makes step 2 resumable and repeat-safe.
 *
 * ── On limits ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * In-app notifications and push are ours and cost nothing, so they are not
 * capped — they drain as fast as the ticks allow.
 *
 * Email is not ours. Every SMTP provider enforces a daily ceiling and a rate,
 * and exceeding either does not bounce one message, it gets the sending domain
 * throttled or suspended — which takes password resets and email verification
 * down with it. So email is paced by two admin settings, and the ceiling is a
 * real number the owner can raise to match their provider rather than a limit
 * invented here. Setting either to 0 means unlimited.

/**
 * One place that decides how mail leaves the platform.
 *
 * The admin **Email settings** tab has always had SMTP host / port / username /
 * password / from-address / from-name boxes, and every one of them wrote a
 * `SystemSetting` row that **nothing ever read** — `lib/email.ts` built its
 * transporter from `process.env` at module load, and `/api/admin/settings/
 * test-email` did the same. So an owner could fill the form in, press Save, get
 * a success toast, press "Send test email", and be told "SMTP not configured".
 *
 * Now the saved settings are the configuration and the env vars are the
 * fallback, which keeps existing deployments (where only env is set) working
 * untouched.
 *
 * The transporter is rebuilt when the settings change rather than held at module
 * scope, because a module-scope transporter can only ever reflect the values
 * that existed when the process booted — that is what made the form dead in the
 * first place. `getSetting` is itself cached, so this is not a query per email.

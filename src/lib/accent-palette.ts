/**
 * The accent surface table — one row per accent, and the only place these
 * colours are written down.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * The app ships 19 accents (profile → Theme). Every one of them remaps the
 * brand ramp, and the app's one gradient, its active-nav rail and its button
 * edge are all drawn from that ramp. Exactly ONE accent had ever been measured:
 * the default. At the 600 step that the gradient needs for white text, a light
 * accent lands near 2.9:1 — so choosing "yellow" or "gold" produced white
 * labels on a bright fill, on the balance panel, and nothing anywhere caught
 * it. The picker was never the problem; not measuring was.
 *
 * HOW THE VALUES WERE CHOSEN — all three rules are mechanical, not taste:
 *
 *   gradA / gradB      The first step, walking 500 → 900, at which WHITE clears
 *                      4.7:1 on BOTH ends (4.5 plus headroom). Cool accents
 *                      settle at 600; every warm one has to step to 700, and
 *                      silver to 800. `gradB` is the accent's companion hue —
 *                      about 30 degrees around the wheel, warm to warm and cool
 *                      to cool — at the same step, which is what makes it read
 *                      as a gradient rather than a flat fill. Where the
 *                      companion lands more than 1.7x away in luminance
 *                      (silver → slate is a silver-to-near-black wash) the row
 *                      falls back to the accent's own ramp one step deeper.
 *
 *   railADark/BDark    The rail, the tab underline and the button edge carry NO
 *   railALight/BLight  text, so their floor is 3:1 against the CHROME, and that
 *                      is a different colour in each theme. Each theme starts
 *                      from the most vivid step that reads on its bar and moves
 *                      only as far as the floor forces it: 400 on the near-black
 *                      bar, 500 on the white one. The two can end up far apart —
 *                      silver is 400 (#c7ced9) in dark and 700 (#6b7688) in
 *                      light, four steps in the opposite direction — which is
 *                      the whole reason they are separate columns.
 *
 * The CSS in globals.css is GENERATED from this table by `accentSurfaceCss()`,
 * and `scripts/verify-app-shell.ts` asserts the stylesheet still contains
 * exactly that string, recomputes every ratio in the table on every run, and
 * fails if the accent list here drifts from `ACCENTS` in the theme provider.
 * So the numbers cannot rot and a new accent cannot ship unmeasured.
 *
 * To change a row: edit it here, run the verify script, and paste the block it
 * prints into globals.css. Never hand-edit the generated block.

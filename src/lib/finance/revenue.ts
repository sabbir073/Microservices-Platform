/**
 * What the platform actually earns, from the columns that already record it.
 *
 * Five of these were being captured and **never added up anywhere**:
 *
 * - `MarketplacePurchase.fee` — no `SUM` of it existed in the codebase.
 *   `/admin/marketplace` shows gross GMV and calls it revenue.
 * - `Withdrawal.fee` — never summed; visible only one row at a time.
 * - `LotterySettlement.houseCutPoints` — the whole table was **read by no
 *   application code at all**, despite its own schema comment saying "finance
 *   reporting reads THIS table".
 * - The offerwall margin — `OfferwallCallback.payoutAmount` (what the network
 *   pays the platform) against `userPayout` (points handed to the user) — never
 *   compared.
 * - The course commission — computed on every sale and written only into
 *   `Transaction.metadata`, with no column until now.
 *
 * Each stream reports `measured: false` when nothing has happened yet, so the
 * console can say "no activity" instead of presenting `$0.00` as a finding.
 * Those are different statements and a finance admin needs to tell them apart.

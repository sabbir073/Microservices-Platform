 * Task instructions, which are now rich text but used not to be.

 * is a rich-text editor now, so new tasks store HTML — but the column is full
 * of the old format and nothing migrates it.
 *
 * So both shapes have to keep working, forever, and the decision of which is
 * which lives here rather than being re-guessed at each of the five places that
 * render instructions. Old tasks keep their numbered steps; new ones get their
 * formatting; nobody has to run a migration over live data to make it so.
 *
 * Client-safe: no server imports, so the admin editor and the user-facing
 * renderers share one definition.

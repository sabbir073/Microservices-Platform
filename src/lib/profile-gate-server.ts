/**
 * The profile gate: things a user cannot do until their profile is complete.
 *
 * Three admin settings, all on Settings → Toggles:
 *   ui.require_profile_completion   master switch (off by default)
 *   profile_gate.mode               ESSENTIALS — the 7 core fields
 *                                   FULL       — the profile ring, up to
 *   profile_gate.min_percent        the percentage the admin requires (10–100)
 *   profile_gate.features           which features lock (see GATE_FEATURES)
 *
 * The gate is only as good as its weakest entry point. It used to be checked by
 * the /tasks page and ONE start route — article tasks, quiz tasks, board
 * claims, mission claims, quiz games and offerwalls all had their own routes
 * and none of them asked, so a locked user could earn through any of them.
 * Every route that lets a user earn now calls `profileGateResponse`.

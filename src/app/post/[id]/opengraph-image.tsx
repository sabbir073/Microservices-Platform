/**
 * The generated share card, for posts with no image of their own.
 *
 * Most posts on the feed are text — and a text post shared to WhatsApp or
 * Facebook with no `og:image` unfurls as a grey stub that nobody clicks. This
 * renders the post's own words onto a card instead.
 *
 * `generateMetadata` in page.tsx sets `openGraph.images` only when the post
 * HAS a picture; when it leaves that key undefined, Next's file convention
 * points `og:image` here. So exactly one of the two ever wins, and the post's
 * real photo always beats the generated card.
 *
 * The private-post rule applies here as hard as it does on the page: a post the
 * gate refuses renders a generic card with NO post content on it. An unfurler
 * that leaked the first 180 characters of a private post would be the same leak
 * as the page itself, just harder to notice.

        <p>
          You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> and legally able to
          enter a contract to use EarnGPT. Some features (such as prize draws or
          withdrawals) may be restricted or unavailable in certain countries; you

          You are responsible for your login credentials and all activity on your
          account. Provide accurate information, keep it up to date, and enable
          two-factor authentication where possible. One person may hold only one
          account; creating multiple or fake accounts to abuse rewards is

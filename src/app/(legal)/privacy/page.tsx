            <strong>Identity verification (KYC)</strong> — when you request higher
            withdrawal limits or the verified badge, we collect government ID

            bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Binance, PayPal handles), earnings, and
            transaction history. We do <em>not</em> store full card numbers;
            card/gateway payments are handled by the payment provider.

        <p>
          We keep your information for as long as your account is active and as
          needed to provide the service. Transaction and KYC records may be kept
          longer where required by financial, tax, or anti-fraud laws. When you

          passwords, optional two-factor authentication (2FA), and access
          controls. No system is perfectly secure, so we cannot guarantee
          absolute security; please use a strong password and enable 2FA.

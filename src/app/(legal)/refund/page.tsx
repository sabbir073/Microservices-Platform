        <p>
          Money you add to your EarnGPT wallet is credited to your balance for use
          on the Platform. Because deposited funds can be spent immediately (for
          example on packages or fees), deposits are generally{" "}
          <strong>non-refundable</strong> once credited. If a deposit failed,
          was duplicated, or was charged in error, contact us and we will
          investigate and correct verified errors.

          <li>
            Paid packages/subscriptions grant access to digital features
            immediately, so they are generally non-refundable once the period has
            started, except where required by law.

          <li>
            <strong>Auto-renewal</strong> can be cancelled at any time from your
            account before the next renewal date. Cancelling stops future charges;
            you keep access until the current period ends.

            Purchases made through the Apple App Store or Google Play are subject

            store.

          Withdrawal requests are processed to your chosen payout method after any
          required verification. A withdrawal cannot be “refunded” once paid out.
          If a withdrawal fails at the provider, the amount is returned to your
          wallet so you can try again.

 * The money record, on its own page.
 *
 * It existed only as a tab inside the wallet, mixed in with every completed
 * task — and on an active account the earnings drown everything else, so
 * "when did my withdrawal go out" or "what did that credit purchase cost"
 * became unanswerable by scrolling.
 *
 * Here the default is money moving: deposits, withdrawals, conversions,
 * purchases, task credit, fees, refunds. The work log is one tap away rather
 * than in the way.

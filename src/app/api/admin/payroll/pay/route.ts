/**
 * Pay one staff member one component of one period.
 *
 * The amount is never taken from the request. The client sends who, which
 * period and which component; the server recomputes what is owed from the saved
 * rates and the measured activity. A client that could name the amount is a
 * client that can pay itself anything.
 *
 * The payment credits the staff member's platform wallet — the only payout rail
 * this codebase has — and is idempotent on `payroll_<kind>_<period>` through the
 * ledger's unique reference, so a retry cannot pay twice.

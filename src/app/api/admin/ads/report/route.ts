 *    (AdSense/GAM) revenue is reported in Google's console and never reaches

 *    disagree with the placement panel next to it on the same screen.
 *  - **Unknown is a row, not a gap.** Events recorded before this shipped, and

 *    chart that quietly drops its unknowns tells the owner his traffic is 100%

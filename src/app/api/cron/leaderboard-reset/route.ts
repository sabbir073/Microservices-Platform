/**
 * Close finished leaderboard cycles and pay the winners — over HTTP.
 *
 * NOTHING DEPENDS ON THIS BEING CALLED. The platform schedules itself off its
 * own traffic (`lib/scheduler/run`, registered in `lib/scheduler/jobs`), which
 * is what the owner asked for: no cron entry, no `CRON_SECRET`, no dashboard.
 * This endpoint is kept because it already existed and is already authenticated
 * — anyone who does want to point an external pinger at it still can.
 *
 * Both paths call the same `lib/leaderboard-auto-reset`, which calls the same
 * `runLeaderboardReset`. Its idempotency rules (`lb_auto_reset` gate, the
 * first-run seal, the window-keyed cycle id, the frozen winner list, the unique
 * ledger reference per credit) are documented there and are unchanged: the UTC
 * bucketing, the missed-window catch-up and `lb_auto_reset_live_since` all live
 * in that file now.
 *
 * Authorised exactly like `/api/cron/recheck-submissions`: `CRON_SECRET` as a
 * bearer token or `?key=`, or a signed-in admin with `leaderboards.manage`.
 * With no `CRON_SECRET` set the unauthenticated route is refused rather than
 * left open — this endpoint moves real money. That refusal is safe precisely
 * because the scheduler no longer needs the endpoint.

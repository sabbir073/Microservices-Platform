/**
 * A buyer pausing or resuming their OWN task.
 *
 * Only an admin could stop a task before this, so a buyer who noticed a typo,
 * ran a promotion they wanted to hold, or simply wanted to stop spending had to
 * ask someone. It is their task and their credit; stopping it is theirs to do.
 *
 * Ownership is in the WHERE clause, not checked afterwards — `fundedByUserId`
 * is part of every query here, so there is no request shape that touches
 * another buyer's task. This deliberately does NOT use the admin permission
 * system: a buyer is not an admin and must never be able to act on a task they
 * did not fund.
 *
 * What a buyer still cannot do is approve or reject the WORK. That stays with
 * admins and Smart Auto Verification, because a buyer who wanted to keep their
 * credit could refuse honest submissions and the worker would carry the loss.

/**
 * Public explainer for advertisers.
 *
 * The slot list is rendered FROM `AD_PLACEMENTS`, which is the same array the
 * renderer and the Ad Manager read. A hand-typed list here would drift the first
 * time a space is added, and an advertiser who bought a space that no longer
 * exists is a refund conversation.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions:
 *  - REWARDED_VIDEO is filtered out. It exists in the codebase but ships OFF,
 *    and a marketing page must not sell inventory that does not run.
 *  - No prices. The click price is a setting (`ads.cpcUsd`) with a per-space
 *    override, and sponsorship rates are per-space columns. Printing today's
 *    figure here would misquote every advertiser who reads it after the next
 *    rate change.

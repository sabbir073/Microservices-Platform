/**
 * Public explainer for the referral programme. Deliberately NOT in the nav —
 * it is linked from the "Team & Referrals" card on the landing page and from
 * the other two marketing pages.
 *
 * ## Why there is not a single number on this page
 *
 * Every referral reward is an admin setting, and `REFERRAL_BONUS_DEFAULTS` in
 * src/lib/referral-config.ts currently has `enabled: false` with every points
 * value and every percentage at 0. Several of the models ship switched off. A
 * page that said "earn 500 points per friend" would therefore be wrong in two
 * separate ways at once: wrong amount, and describing a bonus that is not
 * running.
 *
 * So this page describes the MECHANISMS — which is what the owner can honestly
 * publish today — and points the reader at their own referrals screen, which
 * reads the live configuration. Do not add figures here.

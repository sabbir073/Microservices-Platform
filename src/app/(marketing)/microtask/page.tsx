 * Public explainer for the micro-task side of the platform.
 *
 * Every figure on this page is COMPUTED from the modules that define the thing
 * being counted — the social catalog, the buyer task-type list — never typed in
 * as a literal. A marketing page that hardcodes "40 platforms" is wrong the
 * first time someone adds the forty-first, and nobody re-reads a marketing page
 * when they edit a catalog.
 *
 * Rates are deliberately absent. Every reward on this platform is an
 * admin-configurable setting (points per task, points per dollar, the
 * withdrawal fee); printing today's number on a public page promises a figure
 * the owner can change in the admin panel five minutes later.

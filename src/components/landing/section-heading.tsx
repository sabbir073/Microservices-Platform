/**
 * One section heading for the whole landing page.
 *
 * Six sections had hand-copied heading markup: the same eyebrow chip in four
 * different hues, `text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl` retyped each time, and a
 * bottom margin that was mb-16 in four places and mb-12 in two. That is why
 * the page read as a stack of unrelated blocks rather than one document — the
 * rhythm changed every time you scrolled past a divider.
 *
 * The eyebrow hues are also the reason the badges were unreadable in dark
 * mode: `text-indigo-600` measures 3.00:1 on the dark marketing band. The
 * `mk-eyebrow` class uses the measured accent pair instead (6.97:1 light,
 * 8.23:1 dark).

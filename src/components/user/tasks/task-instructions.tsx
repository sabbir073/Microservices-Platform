/**
 * The instructions block, wherever a task is shown.
 *
 * One component for all five surfaces (social, article, manual, proxy, and the
 * admin detail page) because they were five copies of the same
 * `.split("\n").map(<li>)` and would otherwise have drifted the moment rich
 * text arrived at some of them and not others.
 *
 * Renders whichever shape is stored — see `lib/task-instructions`. Old tasks
 * keep the numbered steps they have always had; new ones get their formatting.
 *
 * Two presentation rules, both because these pages had become walls of text:
 *
 *  - **Steps are numbered rows, not a `list-decimal`.** A tight browser-default
 *    ordered list at 14px reads as a paragraph with digits in it. What a user
 *    scanning a task on a phone needs is to see "1", "2", "3" as separate
 *    things they do in order, which means giving each one a badge and real
 *    space. This is the "step 1 / step 2" the task pages were missing.
 *  - **Long instructions collapse.** Admins paste a lot. Six steps is a
 *    briefing; twenty is a document, and putting a document above the button
 *    the user came to press means they never reach the button.

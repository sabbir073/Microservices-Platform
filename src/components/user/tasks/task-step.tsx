/**
 * One step of a task, the same shape on every task type.
 *
 * Task pages had grown into a single column of same-weight boxes — about,
 * instructions, recipe, verification rules, proof — with nothing saying which
 * came first or where one thing ended and the next began. On a long social task
 * that is several thousand pixels of undifferentiated panels, and a user
 * scrolling it cannot tell what they are supposed to DO.
 *
 * So every surface now numbers its steps the same way: a big serial in the
 * gutter, a title, and the body indented under it. The number is the anchor —
 * "I'm on 2 of 4" is answerable at a glance, on a phone, mid-scroll.
 *
 * The rail down the left is what makes it read as a sequence rather than as a
 * stack of unrelated cards, and it is drawn per-step rather than by the list so
 * a step can be inserted anywhere without the line breaking.

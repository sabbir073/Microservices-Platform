  // height cap anywhere. Every ad in the database is "responsive", so in
  // practice nothing was ever capped: a tall creative rendered `w-full h-auto`
  // and ran for several screens. The loading skeleton above already sized
  // itself from the placement, so the layout jumped when the ad landed.

  // card anyway: image ≤ maxHeightPx, plus a fixed text block.
  //
  // `object-contain` (already on both elements) letterboxes rather than crops,
  // so a tall creative is shown whole at a smaller size instead of being cut.
  //
  // The ratio is ALWAYS set, which it was not before.
  //
  // `Ad.size` defaults to "responsive" and 43 rows resolve to no dimensions at
  // all, so `dim` is null for them and the media rendered `h-auto`: the box was
  // whatever the creative turned out to be, discovered only once the bytes
  // arrived, and everything under it moved. The fallback walks down to the
  // space's own preset and then to 16/9, so a creative that says nothing about
  // itself still reserves a box before it loads. `object-contain` (below) keeps
  // it whole inside that box rather than cropping it to fit.
  // Reserve the space, but only SHAPE it when the creative told us its shape.
  //
  // Two true things pull opposite ways here, and both were fixed once:
  //
  //  - A creative that declares no size used to render `h-auto`, so the box was
  //    whatever the bytes turned out to be and everything under it jumped.
  //  - Forcing the SLOT's ratio onto such a creative is the older bug: a
  //    600x200 image inside a 728x90 box gets contained down to ~270px wide —
  //    smaller than it was before anyone tried to help.
  //
  // So: the creative's own ratio when it has one, and otherwise a `minHeight`
  // instead. Height is all that is needed to stop the jump; constraining the
  // WIDTH as well is what shrank the creative, and a min-height reserves the
  // row without deciding anything about the shape of a picture we have not
  // seen yet. Capped by the space's own ceiling so the reservation can never
  // be taller than the thing it reserves for.
  // NO forced aspect ratio, in either branch.
  //
  // A box plus `object-contain` letterboxes: the creative sits in the middle
  // and the rest is a dark slab. That is what the owner saw as "black bars", and
  // it happens to almost every creative, because almost none matches the shape
  // we picked for it. Even the creative's OWN ratio is not worth forcing — it
  // only ever equals what the image would do by itself.
  //
  // So the image sets its own height (`h-auto`) and `minHeight` reserves the row
  // so nothing jumps while the bytes are in flight. Reserving height does not
  // decide shape, which is the entire difference between the two.

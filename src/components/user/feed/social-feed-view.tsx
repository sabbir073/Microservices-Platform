    // breakpoint that leaves 672px, but two columns need at least 920px — 576
    // for the feed, 24 gap, 320 for the rail, which is `shrink-0`. So every
    // laptop in the 1024–1279px band rendered the feed at ~328px: narrower than
    // a phone, with a full-width rail beside it. 1280px is the first width where
    // both fit, which is why the rail starts at `xl`.
    //
    // The three columns, then: the app's own nav (`lg:pl-72`) is the left rail,
    // this is the centre, the aside is the right. One column on a phone, two
    // from `lg` where the nav appears, three from `xl`. Below `xl` the aside's
    // contents are one tap away in the sheet rather than absent — which is what
    // they used to be.
    //
    // The widths above `xl` are measured, not guessed. At 1920 the feed used to
    // begin 352px right of the nav with 180px of dead space on either side of
    // the pair, because the centring happens twice: `main` centres itself inside
    // `max-w-7xl`, and then this row centred a 920px block inside main's 1216px
    // again. Widening both columns pulls the block left and fills that corridor
    // instead of leaving it down the middle of the screen — the feed now starts
    // 80px further left and the side space is 84px rather than 180px.
    //
    // The rail only grows at `2xl`, and that is the constraint that decides
    // everything else. At exactly 1280 the row has 920px to work with, and
    // 672 + 24 + 416 does not fit: the feed would be squeezed to 480px, NARROWER
    // than it is today. So the rail holds at 320 through the whole xl band and
    // takes its extra width at 1536+, where `main` is capped and the room is

            `sticky` alone pinned this column 80px below the header and then let
            it move with the page — so once the widgets were taller than the
            viewport, the bottom ones could never be brought into view. There was
            no height bound and no overflow, so the column had no scrollbar of its
            own. It stacks Active Events, best earners, who-to-follow, trending
            hashtags, a promo, quick-earn tiles and any custom widgets, which
            clears a laptop screen easily. They are banded under collapsible
            headings now (see FeedRightRail) so the column can be shortened to
            what the viewer actually wants, but the worst case is unchanged.

            6rem = the `top-20` offset plus a little breathing room at the bottom.
            `--anchor-ad-h` is published on the document by AnchorAdBar and is 0px
            when there is no bar, so the rail only gives up height for a strip
            that is actually there — the same allowance `<main>` makes.

            The scrollbar is deliberately the DEFAULT one, not `scrollbar-thin`.
            Measured in a real browser: the rail holds 2423px of widgets in a
            666px window, and the thin variant is 4px wide — which, sitting
            inside `pr-1`'s 4px of padding, was invisible against a dark
            background. The column scrolled perfectly well; nobody could tell
            that it could. `pr-2` keeps the cards clear of the 8px track.

            `overscroll-contain` stops a flick at the end of the rail carrying on
            into the page behind it. */}

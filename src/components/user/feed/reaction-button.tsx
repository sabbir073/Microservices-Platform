/**
 * The like button. One tap, one heart.
 *
 * There used to be a five-emoji picker here, opened by hover on a pointer and
 * press-and-hold on touch. The owner had it removed: on the most-tapped control
 * in the feed, a gesture that can open something you did not ask for is a cost
 * paid on every single tap, and hold-to-open competes with the scroll that
 * starts the same way. Love is the only reaction now.
 *
 * The hit target is the point of the padding here. The action row styles its
 * DIRECT button children — and this component renders its own wrapper, so for
 * as long as that wrapper existed the like button inherited none of it and was
 * about 20x20px. That is why this one control in particular "needed pressing
 * twice". There is no wrapper any more and the padding is on the button.

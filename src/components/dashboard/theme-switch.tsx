/**
 * Light/dark switch for the in-app shell.
 *
 * Separate from `components/landing/theme-toggle.tsx` on purpose: that one
 * flips `data-mk-theme` on the marketing root and is deliberately isolated
 * from the dashboard, so a visitor's choice on the landing page does not
 * follow them into the app. This one drives the real app theme through
 * `useTheme()`.
 *
 * It lives one tap from every screen rather than only in Settings, because a
 * theme is something people change on a whim — in a dark room, in sunlight —
 * and a control buried three taps deep is one they will not find when they
 * want it. It moved out of the header ROW and into the account menu in the
 * same bar: a preference does not earn a permanent slot beside the controls
 * people press every day, and seven equal-weight controls in one row is what
 * "crowded" meant. `withLabel` is the menu-row form.
 *
 * "system" is a real stored value, so pressing this resolves it to whichever
 * side the user is NOT currently looking at, rather than assuming dark.
